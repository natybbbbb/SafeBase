# Contributing

## Workflow
1. Fork and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Keep PRs small and focused.
3. Run tests and linters via GitHub Actions.

## Commits
Use clear, imperative messages in English. Examples: `feat: add escrow refund flow`, `fix: upgrade script address validation`.

## Security
Do not include secrets in code or commits. Use GitHub Actions secrets only.

## Tests
Add tests for new behavior. PRs without tests may be declined.

## Communication
Open an issue before large changes to align on scope and approach.
